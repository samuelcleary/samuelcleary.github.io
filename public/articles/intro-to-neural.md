# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are mathematical models inspired by the human brain.  
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes called **neurons**.

## Key Concepts

- **Neuron:** A unit that processes inputs and produces an output.
- **Weights:** Parameters that adjust the importance of each input.
- **Activation function:** Introduces non-linearity.

## Example

A simple feedforward network can be expressed as:
